# Build log

The build day by day. Dates are 2026. Only the homelab itself is in here.

**Before this log starts:** the ISP router was already in bridge mode behind the main router, the switch was in place, Proxmox was installed on the mini PC, and the DNS box was running Pi-hole, Unbound, the dashboard, the uptime monitor and the auto-updater.

## September

- **08:** Rack shelves arrived.
- **09:** NAS and drives arrived. Drives installed, RAID 1 mirror created, address reserved on the router. Alerting wired to a chat bot. Uptime monitor extended to cover the dashboard, itself, the hypervisor, the router and the NAS. Dashboard filled in with real services instead of the example content. Old tablet set up as a fullscreen dashboard display.
- **10:** RAID sync finished. Linux VM created on the hypervisor. Media server installed, NAS share mounted on the VM, libraries created.
- **11:** Torrent client installed as a system service, saving straight to the NAS.
- **12:** Rack frame arrived. Rack built, cabled and working.
- **15:** Smart plug with energy monitoring put in front of the UPS: the whole rack draws about 30 W. The swap caused a power blip and the NAS stayed off. Auto power-on enabled.
- **21:** Packet capture exercise on the home network (TLS handshakes, service discovery broadcasts, ARP).
- **28:** Full health check, all healthy. QoS set on the router at about 90% of the measured line speed, with priority for the gaming and streaming devices. A larger blocklist added to Pi-hole: blocked queries went from about 3% to about 35%.
- **30:** Hypervisor dropped off the network. Network chip offload fix applied and made permanent. Main VM set to start at boot.

## October

- **03:** Update round across the hypervisor, NAS, router, DNS box and VM. Two stale addresses from the old network found and fixed.
- **04:** The big day.
  - Mesh VPN set up with the hypervisor as subnet router, tested from a phone on mobile data.
  - Media server shared with friends: their own non-admin accounts, and a VPN share that reaches that one port only.
  - Second Pi-hole built in a container, loaded from the first one's export, handed out by the router as secondary DNS.
  - Nightly backup of the DNS box to the NAS.
  - Web server container built. Address conflict found and fixed.
  - Personal cloud built with its data on the NAS. Phone app connected.
  - Dashboard customised: title, theme, logo, background, live numbers on the tiles.
  - Proxmox backups to the NAS, first restore test passed on a throwaway copy, weekly job created for every machine.
  - Router settings exported into the personal cloud.
  - Help desk installed, default accounts disabled, first ticket closed.
- **05:** This repo published. The old `personal-hardware-lab` repo archived.
- **06:** First full weekly backup job confirmed: all four machines present. Nightly DNS box backup confirmed running on its own for three nights. Backup gaps closed: hypervisor host settings, the daily-driver's home folder, and a USB stick on the NAS for the NAS's own settings.
- **07:** Restore test of the DNS box's nightly backup passed: a throwaway uptime monitor started from the backup showed all 12 monitors. Done over SSH from the Mini deck, which also updated the main VM. Windows laptop hardened. PowerShell toolkit written and published. Remote control set up between the laptop and the daily-driver, and the laptop added to the mesh VPN. Repo brought up to date: backups rewritten, new docs for the personal cloud, the web server, the help desk and remote support, the incidents log and this build log.
